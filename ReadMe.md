Timely.js
=========

A lightwieght JavaScript framework that helps manage alerting an end-user that their session is about to timeout.  
Think of it like when you go to your banks website and after a while of sitting in awe of how little money you have, you
get this nice message saying that you need to click a this link to stay logged on.  


###### This is still much a work in progress and is still probably in an Alpha phase

How does it work?

Pass a few paramaters to a method call and you got your self setup.
Just take a look at the example.html file to see an implementation.

##### ToDo
Flush out the Readme.md file!
